1. Select all the samples for the follow analysis should include
Sequencing model: 1 N vs 1 T, only consider the fresh frozen samples

2.  Select all Europeanâ€™s samples for the following analysis should include
Sequencing model: 1 N vs 1 T, only consider the fresh frozen samples, samples based on the PCA population clustering 


Criteria and Procedure

Tumor:
#reasons of duplication:1. test both fresh frozen sample and FFPE sample; 2. test both primary tumor and metastasis tumor; 3. one tumor sample (TCGA-B6-A1KC) test twice 
#So, just remove the duplicated FFPE samples and metastasis samples

Normal:
#reasons of duplication:1. test both blood sample (10A) and para normal tissue sample (11A); 2. sequenced both FFPE and FF para sample ; 3. one blood sample (TCGA-XX-A899) test twice 
#total 55 samples with duplicate, among them: 2 sample with Duplicate FFPE; 1 sample with Duplicated blood; 52 sample with duplicated para
#So, just remove the duplicated FFPE samples, blood and para samples

sample rename with Plink1.9

ped file including:
Family ID
Sample ID
Paternal ID
Maternal ID
Sex (1=male; 2=female; other=unknown)
Affection (0=unknown; 1=unaffected; 2=affected)
Genotypes (space or tab separated, 2 for each marker. 0=missing)

Rather than try to manually edit PED or FAM files (which is not advised), use these functions to change ID codes, sex and parental information for individuals in a fileset. The command
plink --bfile mydata --update-ids recoded.txt --make-bed --out mydata2
