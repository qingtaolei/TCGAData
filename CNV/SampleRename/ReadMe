1. Select all the samples for the follow analysis should include
Sequencing model: 1 N vs 1 T, only consider the fresh frozen samples

2.  Select all Europeanâ€™s samples for the following analysis should include
Sequencing model: 1 N vs 1 T, only consider the fresh frozen samples, samples based on the PCA population clustering 


Criteria and Procedure

Tumor:
#reasons of duplication:1. test both fresh frozen sample and FFPE sample; 2. test both primary tumor and metastasis tumor; 3. one tumor sample (TCGA-B6-A1KC) test twice 
#So, just remove the duplicated FFPE samples and metastasis samples

Normal:
#reasons of duplication:1. test both blood sample (10A) and para normal tissue sample (11A); 2. sequenced both FFPE and FF para sample ; 3. one blood sample (TCGA-XX-A899) test twice 
#total 55 samples with duplicate, among them: 2 sample with Duplicate FFPE; 1 sample with Duplicated blood; 52 sample with duplicated para
#So, just remove the duplicated FFPE samples, blood and para samples
